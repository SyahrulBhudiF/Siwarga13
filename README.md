### **üïô Project Collaboration:**

---

1. Sync Your Fork repository:
   You can click in middle top right in Your GitHub repository: Siwarga13

2. check your git status, specifically in branch:

   ```bash
   git status
   ``` 

   if branch isn't relate to your role, Change Branch to the related Your Role:
   ```bash

   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git checkout Your_Role

7. Push change to fork and don't push to master like 'git push origin master', or you blocked by rule (always check
   branch with steps 2, so push will hit remote branch that role rule targeted):

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

8. Do Pull Request from your fork to main repository to discuss the change with your team:
    - Open your fork in your repository, if in there has notification to compare and pull request hit that button in
      there
    - Create pull request from your fork to main repository branch master

9. (Optional) if when pull had problem with "merge using **ort** strategy", like merge commit with no actual changes
   make your work tree dirty, do this:
   ```bash
   git config pull.ff only
   ``` 
   Note: if there is error when pull, because git config pull.ff=only, do this:
    ```bash
    git config pull.rebase false
    ```

### **üóí Note :**

---

- If there are update change in your fork, always synced that, because you cannot push and crate pull request without
  that
- When Checkout, Push or Pull, always check your git branch
- Don't push to master with 'git push origin master' when add code change to GitHub
- Always create Pull request like steps 8
